Sandwich Generation
Yan is a sandwich enthusiast and is determined to try every combination of sandwich possible. He wants to start with every combination of bread and meats and then move on from there, but he wants to do it in a systematic way.
Below we have 2 tables, bread and meats
Output every possible combination of bread and meats to help Yan in his endeavors.
Order by the bread and then meat alphabetically. This is what Yan prefers.
